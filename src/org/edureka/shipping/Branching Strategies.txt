Branching Strategies

To work efficiently and effectively in a collaborative environment, it is important to have a branching strategy in place. In this case, we can use the GitFlow branching strategy, which is widely used in software development. GitFlow provides a robust framework for managing branches and releases in a complex project.

In GitFlow, there are two main branches:

Master branch: The master branch contains the stable code that has been released to production.

Develop branch: The develop branch is used to merge all the feature branches and to create a release branch.

Apart from these two branches, we have the following types of branches:

Feature branches: Feature branches are used to develop new features. Developers create a feature branch from the develop branch, work on the feature, and merge it back to the develop branch once it is complete.

Release branches: Release branches are created when a new release is ready. Release branches are created from the develop branch and contain only the code that is ready to be released. Once the release branch is tested and verified, it is merged back into both the master and develop branches.

Hotfix branches: Hotfix branches are created when a critical bug is found in the production code. A hotfix branch is created from the master branch, and once the bug is fixed, it is merged back into the master and develop branches.
